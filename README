MKDoc::Core - Application Framework 
===================================

MKDoc::Core is an application framework extracted from the MKDoc content
management system.

It provides the following facilities:

* Pluggable chain of responsibility
* Standard installation procedure
* Multi-website support
* Multi-lingual support

This framework is the foundation for our great 'open source MKDoc as a bunch of
independant modules' plan. On its own it does nothing interesting, but
hopefully it will not stay on its own for very long :)
